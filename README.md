## About the Project

This project was part of my University Individual Project Module. The task was to find, analyse, design, build and write a disseration about a solution that would help solve a real world problem.

The problem that this project solves is to provide a platform/store were users can advertise and sell their new or unwanted products. One of the key features was Augemented Reality (AR), this allowed users to upload 3D models (in GLTF format) to the server which then can be download by another user in an AR session in runtime.
